# What is this repository?
My answers for the questions of the first module of a Data Engineering course, which you can find [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main)

## Question 1. Knowing docker tags

Run the command to get information on Docker 

```docker --help```

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

```docker build --help```

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - *Automatically remove the container when it exits* 

- `--delete`
- `--rc`
- `--rmc`
- `--rm`

### Answer: `--rm`

## Question 2. Understanding docker first run 

Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash.
Now check the python modules that are installed ( use ```pip list``` ). 

What is version of the package *wheel* ?

- 0.42.0
- 1.0.0
- 23.0.1
- 58.1.0

### Answer: `0.42.0`

# Prepare Postgres

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos
We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

```wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv```

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)


## Question 3. Count records 

How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18. 

Remember that `lpep_pickup_datetime` and `lpep_dropoff_datetime` columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

- 15767
- 15612
- 15859
- 89009

### Answer: `15612`
### Query:
``` SQL
WITH sep_18th_records AS (
SELECT *
FROM public.green_september_2019
WHERE
	lpep_pickup_datetime::DATE = '2019-09-18'::DATE AND
	lpep_dropoff_datetime::DATE = '2019-09-18'::DATE
	
)

SELECT COUNT(1) FROM sep_18th_records
```

## Question 4. Largest trip for each day

Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

- 2019-09-18
- 2019-09-16
- 2019-09-26
- 2019-09-21

### Answer: `2019-09-26`
### Query:
``` SQL
SELECT lpep_pickup_datetime::DATE AS day_of_largest_trip
FROM public.green_september_2019
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC
LIMIT 1
```

## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs

Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
 
- "Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"
- "Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
- "Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens" 
- "Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"
